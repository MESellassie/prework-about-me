      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>For many, IT represents an opportunity to engage in a career of the future, a chance to earn more, and the flexibility we all seek in our careers. It is for these reasons that we must ensure the underserved students of the next generation be exposed to this promising opportunities in the IT field. That is why I am so focused on gaining these skills, to share them with the next generation.</p>
